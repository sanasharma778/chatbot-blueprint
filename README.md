##  Setup & Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sanasharma778/FinBot---AI-Personal-Finance-Assistant.git
cd FinBot---AI-Personal-Finance-Assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

##  What I Learned
Building FinBot taught me how LangChain structures conversations using 
SystemMessage, HumanMessage and AIMessage to simulate memory across 
turns. I learned why separating prompts from logic matters for 
maintainability, how Streamlit session_state persists data across 
reruns, and the importance of secure API key management using 
environment variables.

##  What's Next
- Adding a RAG pipeline so FinBot can answer from uploaded financial 
documents
- Integrating real-time UK interest rate and ISA allowance data
- Adding a spending tracker with visual charts
